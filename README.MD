# Dactylo Training

## Project Presentation

Dactylo Training is a side project of mine that aims to modernize 'Dactylo', an old software to train your dactylography. This project is done using HTML 5 and CSS 3 with traditional javascript and no other additional libraries.

## Maintenance

I essentially made this as a web challenge, I do not plan on maintaining it often. I will probably come back to it multiple times to make some additions or changes. I you want to contribute feel free to open a pull request.

## Features

Dactylo Training is composed of 3 main parts: header, input field and additional information about the dactylography session. The goal is to type the highlighted character until there is nothing left. By default, the session starts in 'Perfect Mode', meaning that you absolutely need to type the correct character in order to advance the pointer. Note that this 'mode' can be disabled. Try to make the best 
time scores with the least errors!  
You can also customize the text you're typing using the three buttons in the header to import either text from a file, or plain text or to repeat a word multiple times. But text isn't the only thing to be customizable: three themes are available to vary looks. If needed you can also mute the error sound.

## _In Fine_

I would like to say that this is my first published HTML/CSS/JS project and that I'm still a huge beginner on everything that regards frontend programming. It was really a pleasure to work on this project, I hope you'll enjoy it!
